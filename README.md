## Quests
Code edited by DrOreo002. Will be used on my server, feel free to fork or download it

## Information
This is the fork of this plugin https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/▶-quests-◀-set-up-goals-for-players.23696/ so the code is not 100% mine. Since it open source I'm also going to open source my edit, because well why not?. Anyway if you want to use this. You can just download and build it normally. Keep in mind that I have changed hundreds of code lines and optimized some of it using **lombok**. And this plugin is also depend on my public api **OreoCore** few of the methods are for private use only so you had to make it by ur own
